## Maryland Geojson Layers

Maryland political boundaries in GeoJSON format.

Each layer is simplified to be under 1mb.

Layers ending in `-single` break boundaries into many Polygon features instead of a single Multipolygon.

Use QGIS or [simplify-geojson](https://github.com/maxogden/simplify-geojson) to further simplify to your needs.
